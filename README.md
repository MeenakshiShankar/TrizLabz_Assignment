<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Problem Statement

-->You are developing a mobile robot.
Robot has to detect all the obstacles around it within a radius of 5m.

--> You are provided with a Arduino board, select a suitable sensor and understand how it can be interfaced with Arduino. Implement a software module which will use
the information from the sensors and provide the position of the obstacles.


### Built With

* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
* [Processing](https://processing.org/download/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Download the LiDAR_Stepper_18-05-2021.ino file and open it with Arduino IDE.

The submitted code uses the following library additionally:
* [VL53L0X](https://github.com/pololu/vl53l0x-arduino)
  This github repo was added as library to run and compile the code.
  
Download the LiDAR_Processing_Plot_18-05-2021 file and open it with Processing IDE to obtain the plot of the scan made by the LiDAR.
